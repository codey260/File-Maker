## üìñ File Handling Modes in Python

Python provides flexible modes for file handling. **File Maker** supports the following three essential modes:

| Mode     | Syntax | Description                                                                                         |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read     | `'r'`  | Opens the file for **reading only**. The file must exist. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. |
| Write    | `'w'`  | Opens the file for **writing only**. If the file exists, its contents are **overwritten**. If it does not exist, a new file is created. |
| Append   | `'a'`  | Opens the file for **appending**. New data will be written at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one. |

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. Read Mode (`'r'`)
- **Purpose**: To read the contents of an existing file.
- **Behavior**:  
  - File must already exist or an error will be raised (`FileNotFoundError`).
  - Cursor is set at the start.
- **Typical Usage**:
    ```python
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    ```

#### 2. Write Mode (`'w'`)
- **Purpose**: To create a new file or overwrite an existing file.
- **Behavior**:  
  - If the file exists, all existing data is **deleted**.
  - If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
- **Typical Usage**:
    ```python
    with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write("Hello, World!")
    ```

#### 3. Append Mode (`'a'`)
- **Purpose**: To **add** data to the end of the file without removing existing content.
- **Behavior**:  
  - If the file does not exist, it is created.
  - The file pointer is set at the end.
  - New data is added after existing content.
- **Typical Usage**:
    ```python
    with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
        file.write("\nNew line added!")
    ```
